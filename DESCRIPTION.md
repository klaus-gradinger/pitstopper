- Any motorsport event with timed pit windows

### How It Works

1. Set your race start time (e.g., 09:00)
2. Set when the pit window opens (e.g., 17 minutes after start)
3. Set the pit window duration (e.g., 6 minutes)
4. Mount your phone where the driver can see it
5. Focus on driving - PitStopper handles the timing

When your pit window opens, the screen flashes to alert you. The countdown shows exactly how much time remains. When you stop in the pits, GPS detects your standstill and confirms your stop. Then it automatically starts counting down to your next window.

### Why PitStopper?

Built by racers, for racers. We know that missing a pit window means penalties - or worse, disqualification. PitStopper is designed to be dead simple and impossible to ignore when it matters most.
